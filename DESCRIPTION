Description: A trajectory inference toolkit for flow and mass 
    cytometry data. CytoTree is a valuable tool to build a 
    tree-shaped trajectory using flow and mass cytometry data. 
    The application of CytoTree ranges from clustering 
    and dimensionality reduction to trajectory reconstruction 
    and pseudotime estimation. It offers complete analyzing 
    workflow for flow and mass cytometry data.
